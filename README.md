## About The Project

(Include a screenshot here)

This project is part of the work being carried out by students in a programming bootcamp at [TheBridge](https://www.thebridge.tech/).

The objective of this project is to create an online tool that allows for planning projects for the execution of asynchronous work, improving communication, productivity, and documentation for work teams.

To carry out this project, agile processes are being applied using Scrum. The project is an opportunity for students to put their programming skills into practice and work together to create a useful and effective tool."

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The application uses a pre-defined seed data of users to facilitate login and test the application's functionality. To verify if the seed data is correctly loaded in the LocalStorage, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect".
3. The developer console will open in your browser.
4. Select the "Application" tab.
5. In the panel on the left, find and expand "LocalStorage".
6. You should see the users data keys along with their corresponding values, indicating that the seed data has been loaded correctly.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TheBridge-FullStackDeveloper/ft-feb13-team.git
   ```
